Python scripts for the work of identifiying high-mass starless clumps in the Galactic plane.

From 10861 ATLASGAL clumps, we identify 463 high-mass starless clump (HMSC) candidates with  $$$|l|\<60\deg$$$ and $-1<\deg<b<1\deg$.All of these sources have been queried in SIMBAD to make sure they are not associated with any known 
    star-forming indicator. 
    Young stellar objects were identified from the GLIMPSE catalog 
    using color-based criteria and the associated 
    clumps were excluded. We also make sure 
    that the HMSC candidates have neither point sources at 24 
    and 70 \micron~nor strong 
    extended emission at 24 \micron. 
    Most of the identified HMSCs are infrared
    dark and some are even dark at 70 \micron. Their 
    distribution shows crowding in Galactic spiral arms and toward
    the Galactic center and some well known star-forming complexes,
    and some HMSCs are associated with large-scale filaments.
    Some basic parameters were attained from
    column density and dust temperature maps which were constructed 
    via fitting far-infrared and submillimeter continuum data to
    modified blackbodies. The HMSC candidates have 
    sizes, masses, and densities similar to clumps associated with 
    Class II methanol masers and \hii~regions, suggesting that 
    these starless clumps will evolve into star-forming clumps. More than
    90\% of the HMSC candidates have densities above some
    proposed thresholds for forming high-mass stars. The HMSC candidates 
    have dust temperatures and 
    luminosity-to-mass ratios significantly lower
    than star-forming sources, suggesting 
    they are genuinely at very early stages 
    of high-mass star formation. Seventeen sources with $r_\mathrm{eq}<0.15$ pc
    and $\Sigma>0.08$ g cm$^{-2}$ could be possible
    high-mass starless cores. Further investigations toward
    these HMSCs would undoubtedly shed light on 
    comprehensively understanding 
    the birth of high-mass stars.
